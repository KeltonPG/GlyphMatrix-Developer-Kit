# Glyph Matrix Developer Kit: Build Custom Glyph Experiences

![Glyph Matrix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Glyph_Matrix-Developer_Kit-brightgreen)

## Overview

The Glyph Matrix Developer Kit offers a comprehensive guide for creating custom Glyph Matrix experiences in your app or building your own Glyph Toy on compatible devices. Central to this kit is the GlyphMatrixSDK, an Android library that transforms your designs into Glyph Matrix Data, rendering them frame by frame on the Glyph Matrix. This SDK also provides identifiers to manage events related to the Glyph Button.

## Getting Started

To begin using the GlyphMatrixSDK, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KeltonPG/GlyphMatrix-Developer-Kit.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Ensure you have Android Studio installed.
   - Open the cloned project in Android Studio.

3. **Integrate the SDK**
   - Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:
     ```groovy
     implementation 'com.keltonpg:glyphmatrixsdk:1.0.0'
     ```

4. **Configure Permissions**
   - Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to include necessary permissions for the Glyph Matrix functionality.

5. **Run Your First Example**
   - Navigate to the `examples` directory.
   - Run the sample project to see the Glyph Matrix in action.

## Developing a Glyph Toy Service

Creating a Glyph Toy Service involves managing its lifecycle and handling user interactions. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

### 1. Service Lifecycle

You will need to implement the service lifecycle methods:

- `onCreate()`: Initialize your service.
- `onStartCommand()`: Handle incoming intents.
- `onDestroy()`: Clean up resources.

### 2. Handling Interactions

Use the GlyphMatrixSDK to respond to user inputs. You can listen for button presses and other events using the provided identifiers.

### 3. AOD Capability

If your toy supports Always-On Display (AOD), ensure that your service can manage the state transitions effectively. This includes:

- Activating AOD when necessary.
- Handling updates to the display while in AOD mode.

### Sample Code Snippet

```java
public class MyGlyphToyService extends Service {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        // Initialization code
    }

    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        // Handle interactions
        return START_STICKY;
    }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        // Cleanup code
    }
}
```

## API Reference

The API Reference provides detailed documentation of the classes and methods available in the GlyphMatrixSDK.

### Key Classes

- **GlyphMatrix**: Main class for managing Glyph Matrix rendering.
- **GlyphButton**: Class for handling button events.
- **GlyphToyService**: Base class for creating your Glyph Toy services.

### Important Methods

- `renderFrame()`: Renders a single frame on the Glyph Matrix.
- `registerButtonListener()`: Registers a listener for button events.
- `startAOD()`: Activates Always-On Display mode.

For complete API documentation, please refer to the [API Reference section](#api-reference).

## Examples

Explore the `examples` directory for practical implementations of the GlyphMatrixSDK. These examples demonstrate various features, including:

- Basic Glyph Matrix rendering.
- Handling user interactions.
- Implementing AOD capabilities.

### Example: Simple Glyph Rendering

```java
GlyphMatrix glyphMatrix = new GlyphMatrix();
glyphMatrix.renderFrame(yourDesignData);
```
